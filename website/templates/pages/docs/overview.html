    <h1>Overview</h1>

    <p>The Infinit technology allows for the creation of heterogeneous storage infrastructure by aggregating various storage resources and unifying them into a UNIX-like Infinit file system.</p>

    <img src="${url('images/schema-global.png')}" alt="Schema of Infinit"><br>

    <p>Infinit file systems benefit from several advantages over the centralized and distributed file systems commonly used.</p>

    <div class="features">
        <h3><img src="${url('images/icons/control.png')}"> Control</h3>

        <div>
        <h2>Secure</h2>
        <p>All the files stored are cut into chunk and every chunk is encrypted (RSA/AES-256) with a unique key.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
        <h2>Control</h2>
        <p>Control the localisation of your data by selecting the storage resources/providers involved in the infrastructure.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
        <h2>Reliable</h2>
        <p>Every block of every file is dynamically replicated several times (configurable by the administrator) in order to ensure durability and availability of the data.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
        <h2>Fault Tolerant</h2>
        <p>Detects failures and automatically adapts the number of replicas in order to guarantee the reliability of the data.</p>
        </div>


        <h3><img src="${url('images/icons/scalable.png')}"> Scalability</h3>

        <div>
        <h2>Flexible</h2>
        <p>Manage your needs in terms of storage capacity by increasing/decreasing (scale up/down) contributions from existing providers and/or adding/removing (scale out/in) storage resources without interrupting the service.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
        <h2>Scalable</h2>
        <p>With a peer-to-peer foundation, Infinit does not suffer single points of failure or bottlenecks.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="clear">
        <h2>High Performance</h2>
        <p>Benefit from a high-throughput UDP-based network protocol for faster data retrieval.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
        <h2>Adaptability</h2>
        <p>In the event of a failure, the system heals itself by automatically adjusting the number of replicas.</p>
        </div>


        <h3><img src="${url('images/icons/keyboard.png')}"> Administration</h3>

        <div>
        <h2>Migration</h2>
        <p>Easily migrate your data from one provider to another whenever you need without any service interruption.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
        <h2>Access Control</h2>
        <p>Decide who can read/edit files and folders through fine-grained access control capabilities.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
        <h2>Affordable</h2>
        <p>No need to acquire specific hardware/appliance or setup/maintain a complicated server-side installation.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
        <h2>Versioning</h2>
        <p>Browse through the different versions of a file and rollback if necessary.</p>
        </div>


        <h3><img src="${url('images/icons/infinit-cloud-apps.png')}"> Interface</h3>

        <div>
        <h2>Natural</h2>
        <p>Access your files on any device, from anywhere at any time through a native file system interface.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
        <h2>Interoperability</h2>
        <p>Runs on your dearest operating system (hopefully!): MacOS X, Windows, Linux, iOS and Android</p>
        </div>

        <div>
        <h2>On Demand</h2>
        <p>Access/stream the files on-demand without the need to store the files locally or download them before.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
